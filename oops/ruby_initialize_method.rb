## RubyInitializeMethod | RubyConstructors

=begin
## Important points
1. Constructors are used to initialize the instance variables.
2. Whenever an object of the class is created using new method, internally it calls the 
  initialize method on the new object.
3. Constructors canâ€™t be inherited.
